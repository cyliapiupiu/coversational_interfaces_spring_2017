## Phatic communion.

- Church singing (where "communion" might come from)

- utterances that are said to have exclusively social, bonding functions like establishing and main- taining a friendly and harmonious atmosphere in interpersonal relations, especially during the opening and closing stages of social — verbal — encounters. 

- In fact they may transfer information: Even greetings and apologies which are formulaic can claim relative status, for example. Laver: "the fundamental function of the [...] communicative behavior that accompanies and includes phatic communion is the detailed management of interpersonal relationships during the psychologically crucial margins of interactions"

I.e: Phatic communion [...] serves to establish and consolidate the interpersonal relationship between two participants 

Laver: The information exchanged between the participants in this communicative process is not primarily referential information, but rather is indexical information about aspects of the participants' social identity relevant to structuring the interactional consensus of the present and future encounters. 

Laver: it also provides the participants with a subtle tool for use in staking indexical claims which shape and constrain their detailed relationship in the crucial marginal phases of encounters when their psychological comfort is most at risk.
